# Walking through 
![[Screen Shot 2020-09-28 at 9.58.19 PM.png]]

1. **Listen Carefully** 
	- Make sure you hear the problem correctly
	- You do want to ask questions about any thing 
	- _Mentally recorded any unique information in the problem_
2. **Draw an Example**
	- An example can dramatically improve your ability to solve an interview question
	- When you hear a question, get out of chair, go to whiteboard and draw an example
	- You want an good example
	- Create an example that is 
		- **Specific** - It should be real number or String 
		- **Sufficiently Large**
		- **Not a Special Case**
3. **State a Brute Force**
	-	It's okay and expected that your initial algorithm won't be very optimal.
	-	It's okay that this initial solution is terrible.
	-	***Space and time complexity is important***
	-	Despite being possible slow a brute force algorithm is valuable to discuss
	-	It's a starting point for optimizations
4. **Optimize**
	- Once you have a brute force algorithm, work on optimizing it.
		1. Look for any unused information 
		2. Use a fresh example
		3. Solve it incorrectly
			- Having an incorrect solution might help in finding correct solution.
		4. Make time vs Space trade offs
		5. Precompute Information - Is there is a way that you can reorganize the data (sorting etc.)
		6. **Use a Hash Table**
		7. Think about the best conceivable runtime [Best conceivable runtime](Technical%20Questions/##%20Best%20conceivable%20runtime.md)
5. **Walk Through**
	- After getting to optimal solution don't just dive into coding.
	- Take moment to solidify understanding of algorithm
	- Whiteboard coding is slow, so make sure you get it as close to "perfect" in teh beginning as possible
	- Walk through your algo
	- Get a feel for the structure of code
	- Know what the variables are and when they change
	- *DONOT WRITE PSEUDOCODE, GET IN HABIT OF WRITING REAL CODE*
> If you don't understand correctly, you will struggle to code , means more time to finish code, means more errors, means NOT GOOD.
6. **Implement**
	- Implement it
	- Start Coding - In the far top left of white board
	- Avoid "_Line Creeps_" (Awkward Slant)
	- Beautiful Code means:
		- **Modularized Code** - Don't waste your time in writing initializing code. i.e. matrix initialization <br/> `{{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, ...}` 
			- Use other classes/struct where appropriate
		- **Error Checks** - Add TODO and explain out load what you would like to test.
		- **Good Variable Name**
			- Single Letter variables everywhere is difficult to read
			- Long variable names can also be slow to write
			- Good compromise that most interviewers will be okay with is to abbreviate it after its first usage
	- Focus on writing beautiful code
	- If you see something you can refactor later on, then explain the interviewer and decide weather or not its worth the time to do so.
7. **Test**
	- Take their earlier example, test it against the code, this might discover some bugs and really long time to do so.
	- _Hand Testing_ is very slow. 
	- Instead Try below approach
		1. **Start with _conceptual_ test** - A conceptual test means just reading and analyzing what each line of code does.
			- Think as in you're explaining the lines of code of a code reviewer
		2. **Weird looking code** - Think as if silly mistake.
		3. **Hot spots**
			- Base case in recursive code
			- Integer division
			- Null Nodes in binary trees
			- The start and end of iteration through a linked list
		4. **Small test cases** - Faster to do 
		5. **Special Cases** 
			- Test your code against null or single element values
			- The extreme cases
			- Other special cases
