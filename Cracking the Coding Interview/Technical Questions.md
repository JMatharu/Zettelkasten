# How to Prepare
1.	**Try to solve problem on your own** - When solving a problem make sure to think about ___space and time efficiency___.
2.	**Write the code on paper**  
3.	**Test your code** - Testing the general cases, base cases, error cases and so on.
4.	**Type your paper code as-is into a computer**

1. **Listen Carefully** 
	- Make sure you hear the problem correctly
	- You do want to ask questions about any thing 
	- _Mentally recorded any unique information in the problem_

2. **Draw an Example**
	- An example can dramatically improve your ability to solve an interview question
	- When you hear a question, get out of chair, go to whiteboard and draw an example
	- You want an good example
	- Create an example that is 
		- **Specific** - It should be real number or String 
		- **Sufficiently Large**
		- **Not a Special Case**

3. **State a Brute Force**
	-	It's okay and expected that your initial algorithm won't be very optimal.
	-	It's okay that this initial solution is terrible.
	-	***Space and time complexity is important***
	-	Despite being possible slow a brute force algorithm is valuable to discuss
	-	It's a starting point for optimizations
