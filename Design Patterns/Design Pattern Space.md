- **Class Patterns**
	- Patterns deals with relationship between classes and their subclass
	- These relationships are established through inheritence, so they are static fixed at compile-time
	- _Creational_ 
		- Defer some part of object creation to subclasses
	- _Structural_
		- Inheritence to compose classes
	- _Behavioural_
		- Inheritence to describe algorithms and flow of control 

- **Object Patterns**
	- Patterns deals with object relationships, which can be changed at run-time and are more dynamic
	- _Creational_
		- Defer some part of object creation to another object 
	- _Structural_
		- Describes ways to assemble objects
	- _Behavioural_
		- Describes how a group of object cooperate to perform a task that no single object can carry out alone

>Almost all patterns use inheritence to some extent
